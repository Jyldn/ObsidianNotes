## Lemmatisation
The algorithmic process of determining the correct lemma of a word based on its intended meaning within the context of an expression. Unlike [[Stemming]], lemmatisation identifies the intended part of speech and the correct lemma associated with the word by parsing the context of the entire sentence, paragraph, or document.
