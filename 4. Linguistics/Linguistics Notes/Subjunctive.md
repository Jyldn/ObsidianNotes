The subjunctive [[Grammatical mood]], also called the **conjunctive**, usually employs a [[Subordinate clause]]. It is used for dicussing hypotheticals, opinions, emotions, polite requests. The subjunctive exists in English, but it is not inflectional, but rather a clause type that uses the bare form of the verb that is also used in imperatives and infinitives. 
- John would eat if he **were** hungry.
- Johannes äße, wenn er hungrig **wäre**.
- Jean mangerait s’il **avait** faim.
Contrast this to:
- Jill knows/believes that Paul is drinking some water.

# The Difference
[Video](https://youtu.be/CkdKLE1ABwc?si=FzjtzdrNZJapF25Y) about the difference between subjunctive and conditional.

**Conditional** tenses express what one **would do**. It has a subordinating *if* clause and an independent *then* clause.
- When the car hits 120km/h, it starts to vibrate.
- If you think you can succeed, you try harder.
- If I had a million dollars, I would quit my job.
The placement of the comma in the sentence "If I had a million dollars, I would quit my job." is correct. This sentence is an example of a conditional sentence, specifically a first conditional sentence. If the main clause comes first, no comma is needed. See [[English commas]].
- If I had a million dollars, I would quit my job. (Comma is used)
- I would quit my job if I had a million dollars. (No comma needed)
Conditional sentences ==can include the subjunctive==.
- If I <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">were</mark> your wife, I ==would poison your tea==.
- If I <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">were</mark> your husband, I ==might drink it==.
- If you stopped to think, you ==would realise== that you're wrong. (Note that this does not use the subjunctive.)
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">All I ask</mark> is that you <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">grant</mark> me a fair hearing. (Request, therefore subjunctive.)
