A nonfinite verb form that has some of the characteristics of both verbs and adjectives. Participle has been defined as "a word derived from a verb and used as an adjective, as in a laughing face"

The word participle comes from classical Latin *==participium==*, from *particeps* 'sharing, participation', ==because it shares certain properties of verbs, adjectives, and adverbs==.

*The person running down the street kicked my dog.*
Here, the only verb is *kicked*. *Running down the street* is an **adjective phrase** using *running* as a present participle.
