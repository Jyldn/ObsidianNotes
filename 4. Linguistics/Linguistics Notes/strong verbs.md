A verb is strong if it forms their past tense through a process called **ablaut**. This is when the verbs **internal vowel** changes. This occurs in German languages and is a concept restricted to those languages. For example: *finden > fand, helfen > half, falled > fiel*

**Weak verbs** form their past-tense with the *-te* ending, such as *lernte, arbeitete*. 

So, when combining the concepts of strong/weak verbs with irregular/regular, you find words like *brachte*, which is an **irregular strong verb**.
