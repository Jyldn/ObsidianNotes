"Qu'est-ce que" is a common French phrase used to ask questions. It literally translates to =="What is it that"== in English, but a more ==natural translation is simply "What."==
- **Qu'**: This is a contraction of "que" (what) and is used before a vowel or a mute 'h' for ease of pronunciation. It means "what."
- **est-ce**: This is a form of the verb "être" (to be), which, in this case, is used as a linking verb.
- **que**: This "que" is a relative pronoun that connects the question word to the rest of the sentence.
# Est-ce que
Literally translates as "Is it that," but in practice, it's simply a way to turn a statement into a question.

Unlike "Qu'est-ce que," which is used when the question word ("what") is seeking information about the object of the verb, "Est-ce que" is used to turn any statement into a question, regardless of what information is being sought.

In the example "Est-ce que les étudiants comprennent pourquoi cela est nécessaire," the use of "Est-ce que" ==turns the statement== "les étudiants comprennent pourquoi cela est nécessaire" (the students understand why that is necessary) ==into a question==.
# Difference
**Qu'est-ce que:** =="What is it that"== and is used to ask =="What" questions== in French.
- **Qu'est-ce que tu fais?:**" *What are you doing?*

**Est-ce que:** ==Turns a statement into a question==. It doesn't have a direct English translation but can be thought of as a way to indicate a question is being asked. It is not specifically related to "why" questions. 
- **Est-ce que tu vas bien?:** *Are you okay?* (literally, "Is it that you are well?")

**For "how" and "why" questions in French:**
- **Comment** for "how" questions: « Comment vas-tu? » ("How are you?")
- **Pourquoi** for "why" questions: « Pourquoi es-tu triste? » ("Why are you sad?")
