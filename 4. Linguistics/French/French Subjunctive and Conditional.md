# Subjunctive
Two clauses, two parts of the sentence, and you are saying that ==the second part of the sentence is being affected by the first part of the sentence==. This doesn't happen in English.
- I am happy that you are coming: fine in French.
- I want you to come: not fine in French. Must be something like *I want that you come*.

Think of the [[Indicative]] like a **reporter** speaking.
- *I can see him coming:* Think of the indicative like a **reporter**, he is reporting what is literally happening.
- *I want that you come:* subjunctive, expressing something you want, it isn't literally happening.
