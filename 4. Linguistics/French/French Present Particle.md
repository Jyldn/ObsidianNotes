The French present participle, which ==always ends in –ant==, may be used as a verb, gerund, noun, or adjective. Because it has no number or person marker, it’s an ==impersonal verb mood==.
## Is it Present Continuous?
Structurally, French present participles are ==equivalent to "verb + ing"== in English, but ==grammatically there are many differences between them==.

### Present Participle
While the present [[Participle]] and gerund look identical, ==the gerund is almost always indicated by the preposition en==, and the meaning is different.
*Nous avons vu Thomas mangeant en ville. ->* We saw Thomas eating in town.
The present participle is modifying the nearest noun, Thomas.

*Voulant partir, il a demandé son anorak.* -> Wanting to leave, he asked for his jacket.
